# mBlockExtension-TCS230ColorSensor
Color Sensor TCS230 Extension for mBlock

This is a simple wrapper around Arduino samples for this sensor. 

Here is an example Arduino code:
http://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-color-sensing-tutorial-tcs230-tcs3200-color-sensor/

And as explained there, values for the detected colors drop in the sensor readings. For example, if you bring a red colored object in front of the sensor, the red readings will drop. In the above link, this is explained right above the image where the author is holding a red paper in front of the sensor. 

This extension works both with Arduino and Scratch modes.
